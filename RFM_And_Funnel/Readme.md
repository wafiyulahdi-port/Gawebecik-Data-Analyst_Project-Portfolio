This project implements an end-to-end RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation pipeline for end users using transactional sales data stored in MySQL. The script extracts, cleans, and filters customer purchase data (including return-behavior exclusion), calculates RFM metrics per customer and product, and applies K-Means clustering to classify customers into segments such as Champion, Loyal, Potential Loyal, and Hibernate. It also enriches the segmentation with a product consumption–based funnel status (Hot, Warm, Cold) derived from estimated product depletion timelines, computes repeat-order scores, and consolidates all results into a final dataset. The processed data is then automatically uploaded to a MySQL table as part of an automated ETL workflow, with logging and error handling included for production use.
